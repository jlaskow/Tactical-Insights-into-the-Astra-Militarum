# Attributes and Terminology

Any faction army consists of figurines (or units) with pre-written stats. Depending on the units you choose, you can optimize your army to perform different strategies. Understanding the attributes and stats of each unit is key to finding the optimal strategy.

## Attributes


### points_value

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa9050a9-f6d8-48a8-b011-82b14a0d51c9)

 Each unit has a point cost, limiting the number of assets you can put on the board; such point costs can increase if you equip a unit with weapon upgrades or additional special abilities. 

  - For example, in a 100-point game, a player might assemble 5 Space Marines at 20 points each (100 total). You could, instead, assemble 2 Space Marines upgraded with more powerful weaponry (50 points each).

### model_count

A unit can exist on its own or in a squad, where all units act as one and gain additional perks. The minimum number of units required to form a squad depends on the unit in question; similarly, maximum units per squad is dependent on the unit.

### movement

Movement determines how many inches a unit may move per turn

### weapon_skill

Weapon skill determines a unit's effectiveness in melee combat. The weapon_skill determines the minimum value you must roll on a 6-sided die (1d6) in order to successfully attack in melee with a unit. 

### ballistic_skill

Weapon skill determines a unit's effectiveness in ranged combat. The weapon_skill determines the minimum value you must roll on a 6-sided die (1d6) in order to successfully attack at range with a unit. 

### strength and toughness

Assuming a unit succeeds on its weapon/ballistic skill check, the controlling player compare's the unit's strength value to the target's toughness. If:

- strength < toughness:
  Player rolls a 1d6. On a 5+, the unit inflicts damage to the target
  
- strength = toughness:
  Player rolls a 1d6. On a 4+, the unit inflicts damage to the target

- strength > toughness:
  Player rolls a 1d6. On a 2+, the unit inflicts damage to the target

### attacks

The number of attacks a unit may attampt per turn

### leadership

Leadership represens the minimum number you must roll on a 1d6 for a unit to resist debilitating conditions in combat. The higher the minimum, the more difficult it is for that unit to resist a condition (see Conditions in Terminology  section for more information)

### saves

If a unit successfully roles to attack and overcomes the strength vs toughness challenge, the target must make a save or take a wound. The higher the save value, the higher the target must role on a 1d6 to resist taking a wound. 

### wounds

This determines the amount of damage a unit can sustain before being eliminated

### damage

On a succesful attack a target that fails its save, damage represents the number wound penalties deducted by the target.
