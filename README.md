# Tactical-Insights-into-the-Astra-Militarum

Warhammer 40K is a popular table-top game published by Games Workshop, a manufacturing company based in Nottingham, England - best known for the manufacture and distribution of 'miniature wargames'. The most popular of their products, as previously mentioned, is Warhammer 40K, which sees player pit opposing armies, represented by miniature figurines, against each other. 

This franchise has become highly lucrative, generating an estimated Â£ 445.4 million in 2023 alone. Since its creation in 1975, the developers have introduced a litany of 'factions' to suit different playstyles. As an exercise in the use of SQL and NoSQl databases, we will build a database catalouging the various factions this game has to offer. In time, we hope that this data can be explored to identify potential strategies available for each faction.

Kaggle houses multiple public datasets that record stats on figurines from these various factions. Each figurine comes with a 'cost' and an assorted  list of additional traits that dictate how they can be used in a game.
